##### Notes
Some prefer the indicator lined up with the chart, you can remove the displacement on the indicators to make it a non-leading indicator if you wish. The standard is to draw the indicators before the candles to estimate the moving average convergences and divergences.
I set displacement to -50 so you need 50 bars extension to the right to use the indicator with the leading function.
